# About

This Repo Contains ipynb files for kaggle Competition "CMI - Detect Behavior with Sensor Data" - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data


There are 3 Files 

- EDA file
- Preprocessing + Modeling using LightGBM.
- Preprocessing + Modeling using CNN and GRU.


##### Right Now performance of these models are just better than Baseline.
Things I want to try out - 
* Outlier Handling 
* use more features (LightGBM), i reduced feature to check results quickly, increasing features can give 0.02-0.05 boost on score.
* Handling Class Imabalance.
* Using a Curated Dataset. 
* Use Transformers (but data is less).
* Post Processing. 
* More Preprocessing and Feature engineering
